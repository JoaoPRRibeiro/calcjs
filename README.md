# calcjs
A simple calculator to training programing logic. You can type the numbers and operators in your keyboard but also in the buttons on the screen. If you want to copy the result you have to just click on the copy button and the result will be on your clipboard. If you try any operation that JS does not recognises, there will be a error message. Hope you enjoy it!
